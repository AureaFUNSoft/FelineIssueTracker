# Feline Issue Tracker
An issue tracker for Feline, a game from AUREA FUNSoft

This is just an issue tracker for AUREA's Feline game. I will not post the code here, unless you bought it for $500000... LOL JK.

Anyway you can download the demo here.

**This is the minimum requirement for the game:**
* Chipset LEADCORE quad-core @1,5Ghz
* RAM 1 GB
* GPU MALI T-628
* ANDROID 6.0 MARSMELLOW

This is the spec of my test device.
If your device better than that, you can play the game.
If not, it maybe can play it, but I dont guarantee it. Just install and see for yourself.
